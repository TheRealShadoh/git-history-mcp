# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Git History MCP Server - A Model Context Protocol server that analyzes git history to generate comprehensive development reports with detailed code analysis, contributor information, time estimates, PDF export capabilities, and repository management tools.

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Run in development mode (with tsx)
npm run dev

# Run the built server
npm start

# Test MCP communication directly
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | node ./dist/index.js

# Test with MCP Inspector (interactive UI)
npm run inspector
```

### Environment Setup
No environment setup required. The server works with any Git repository in the current working directory or can be configured to work with remote repositories using the built-in repository management tools.

## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **index.ts**: MCP server entry point implementing STDIO transport and tool handlers
- **git-parser.ts**: Extracts git history, analyzes branches, and identifies features
- **issue-generator.ts**: Transforms git data into detailed issue format
- **executive-summary-generator.ts**: Enhanced executive summary generator with accurate time estimation
- **issue-tracker.ts**: Persistent tracking of created issues to prevent duplicates
- **pdf-generator.ts**: Converts markdown to PDF with mermaid chart rendering via Puppeteer
- **types.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for data structures

### Key Design Patterns
1. **MCP Tool Pattern**: Each major function exposed as an MCP tool with structured inputs/outputs
2. **Async Pipeline**: Git parsing â†’ Issue generation â†’ PDF export flows asynchronously
3. **Persistent State**: Issue tracker uses JSON file storage for cross-session tracking
4. **Chart Generation**: Dynamic mermaid charts embedded in markdown and rendered in PDFs
5. **Enhanced Analytics**: Evidence-based time estimation with quality assurance overhead multipliers

## Distribution Requirements âœ…

### NPM Publishing Configuration (COMPLETED)
1. **package.json updates** âœ…:
   - Added `"bin": { "git-history-mcp": "./dist/index.js" }`
   - Added `"files": ["dist", "README.md", "LICENSE"]`
   - Added `"prepare": "npm run build"`

2. **Build script enhancements** âœ…:
   - Build script sets executable permissions: `tsc && chmod +x dist/index.js`
   - Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) is preserved in built files

3. **STDIO Transport Rules**:
   - **NEVER** write to stdout - it corrupts JSON-RPC messages
   - All logging must go to stderr or be disabled

### Testing
- Added MCP Inspector script: `npm run inspector`
- Verified STDIO transport works correctly
- Confirmed executable permissions are set

## MCP Tools Reference

### Core Git Analysis (4 tools)
- `parse_git_history`: Analyzes git branches and commits with detailed change analysis
- `get_commit_diff`: Gets detailed diff information for specific commits with file changes and patches
- `suggest_commit_message`: Suggests improved commit messages based on actual changes using conventional format
- `find_similar_commits`: Finds commits with similar changes or patterns

### Documentation & Release Management (2 tools)
- `generate_changelog`: Generates changelogs between git references with conventional commit formatting
- `generate_release_notes`: Creates comprehensive release notes with highlights and contributor statistics

### Team & Code Analysis (2 tools)
- `analyze_code_ownership`: Analyzes code ownership and expertise for files/directories
- `analyze_commit_patterns`: Analyzes developer productivity metrics and commit patterns

### Repository Management (4 tools)
- `set_repository_path`: Switch to a different local repository path
- `clone_repository`: Clone remote repositories for analysis
- `checkout_branch`: Switch branches within the current repository  
- `pull_repository`: Pull latest changes from remote repositories

### Issue Data & Reporting (2 tools)
- `generate_detailed_issues`: Creates comprehensive issue data from git history
- `generate_executive_development_summary`: Creates enhanced executive-level development reports with accurate time estimation, individual developer analysis, temporal patterns, and actionable recommendations

### Export & Utilities (5 tools)
- `export_markdown_to_pdf`: Converts markdown reports to PDF with mermaid chart rendering
- `check_issue_exists`: Verifies if an issue was already created for a commit
- `mark_issue_created`: Records successful issue creation in tracking system
- `get_issue_tracker_stats`: Shows tracking statistics and processed issue counts
- `reset_issue_tracker`: Clears all tracking data (useful for testing)

## Testing MCP Server

```bash
# After building, test tools listing
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/list", "params": {}}' | node ./dist/index.js

# Test a specific tool (parse_git_history)
echo '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2, "method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "parse_git_history", "arguments": {"repoPath": ".", "targetBranch": "main"}}}' | node ./dist/index.js
```

## Important Constraints

1. **STDIO Transport**: Server uses stdin/stdout for JSON-RPC - no console.log allowed
2. **Async Operations**: All git operations and PDF generation are async
3. **File Permissions**: Issue tracker writes to `.git-history-issue-tracker.json`
4. **Security**: Repository operations use standard Git protocols
5. **PDF Generation**: Requires headless Chrome via Puppeteer

## Common Development Tasks

When implementing new features:
1. Add tool definition in index.ts following existing pattern
2. Implement core logic in separate module
3. Update types.ts with new interfaces
4. Test via direct JSON-RPC before MCP client integration
5. Ensure no stdout output in implementation
